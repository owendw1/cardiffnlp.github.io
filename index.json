We combined existing corpora with suitable texts collected from the Web, thus creating the largest available dataset for ARA of Spanish texts. All data was pre-processed and categorised to allow experimenting with ARA models that make predictions at two (simple and complex) or three (basic, intermediate, and advanced) readability levels, and at two text granularities (paragraphs and sentences). An analysis based on readability indices shows that our proposed datasets groupings are suitable for their designated readability level. We use our benchmark to train neural ARA models based on BERT in zero-shot, few-shot, and cross-lingual settings. Results show that either a monolingual or multilingual pre-trained model can achieve good results when fine-tuned in language-specific data. In addition, all mod- els decrease their performance when predicting three classes instead of two, showing opportunities for the development of better ARA models for Spanish with existing resources.","tags":[],"title":"A Benchmark for Neural Readability Assessment of Texts in Spanish","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Asahi Ushio","Fernando Alva-Manchego","Jose Camacho-Collados"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1669852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676384572,"objectID":"73d7ecb137ff809211db7acf61c0452f","permalink":"https://cardiffnlp.github.io/publication/ushio-etal-2022-generative/","publishdate":"2023-02-14T14:22:51.86905Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ushio-etal-2022-generative/","section":"publication","summary":"Powerful generative models have led to recent progress in question generation (QG). However, it is difficult to measure advances in QG research since there are no standardized resources that allow a uniform comparison among approaches. In this paper, we introduce QG-Bench, a multilingual and multidomain benchmark for QG that unifies existing question answering datasets by converting them to a standard QG setting. It includes general-purpose datasets such as SQuAD for English, datasets from ten domains and two styles, as well as datasets in eight different languages. Using QG-Bench as a reference, we perform an extensive analysis of the capabilities of language models for the task. First, we propose robust QG baselines based on fine-tuning generative language models. Then, we complement automatic evaluation based on standard metrics with an extensive manual evaluation, which in turn sheds light on the difficulty of evaluating QG models. Finally, we analyse both the domain adaptability of these models as well as the effectiveness of multilingual models in languages other than English.QG-Bench is released along with the fine-tuned models presented in the paper (https://github.com/asahi417/lm-question-generation), which are also available as a demo (https://autoqg.net/).","tags":[],"title":"Generative Language Models for Paragraph-Level Question Generation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aleks Edwards","Asahi Ushio","Jose Camacho-Collados","Hélène de Ribaupierre","Alun Preece"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1669852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676388903,"objectID":"37fc5ea158088a0aa02c5a38556562d8","permalink":"https://cardiffnlp.github.io/publication/edwards-etal-2022-guiding/","publishdate":"2023-02-14T15:35:03.124633Z","relpermalink":"/publication/edwards-etal-2022-guiding/","section":"publication","summary":"Data augmentation techniques are widely used for enhancing the performance of machine learning models by tackling class imbalance issues and data sparsity.

In this paper, we leverage GPT-2 (Radford et al, 2019) for generating artificial training instances in order to improve classification performance. Our aim is to analyse the impact the selection process of seed training examples has over the quality of GPT-generated samples and consequently the classifier performance. We propose a human-in-the-loop approach for selecting seed samples. Further, we compare the approach to other seed selection strategies that exploit the characteristics of specialised domains such as human-created class hierarchical structure and the presence of noun phrases. Our results show that fine-tuning GPT-2 in a handful of label instances leads to consistent classification improvements and outperform competitive baselines. The seed selection strategies developed in this work lead to significant improvements over random seed selection for specialised domains. We show that guiding text generation through domain expert selection can lead to further improvements, which opens up interesting research avenues for combining generative models and active learning.","tags":[],"title":"Guiding Generative Language Models for Data Augmentation in Few-Shot Text Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeffri Murrugarra-Llerena","Fernando Alva-Manchego","Nils Murrugarra-Llerena"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1669852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676384572,"objectID":"ca38b8ab768b662b62593735345829ac","permalink":"https://cardiffnlp.github.io/publication/murrugarra-llerena-etal-2022-improving/","publishdate":"2023-02-14T14:22:52.254197Z","relpermalink":"/publication/murrugarra-llerena-etal-2022-improving/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose an approach for comparing curricula of study programs in higher education.

When it comes to pre-trained language models (PLM), prior work has been focusing on probing relational knowledge this by filling the blanks in pre-defined prompts such as ``The capital of France is ---''. However, these probes may be affected by the co-occurrence of target relation words and entities (e.g. ``capital″, ``France″ and ``Paris″) in the pre-training corpus. In this work, we extend these probing methodologies leveraging analogical proportions as a proxy to probe relational knowledge in transformer-based PLMs without directly presenting the desired relation. In particular, we analysed the ability of PLMs to understand (1) the directionality of a given relation (e.g. Paris-France is not the same as France-Paris); (2) the ability to distinguish types on a given relation (both France and Japan are countries); and (3) the relation itself (Paris is the capital of France, but not Rome). Our results show how PLMs are extremely accurate at (1) and (2), but have clear room for improvement for (3). To better understand the reasons behind this behaviour and mistakes made by PLMs, we provide an extended quantitative analysis based on relevant factors such as frequency.","tags":[],"title":"Probing Relational Knowledge in Language Models via Word Analogies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jose Camacho-Collados","Kiamehr Rezaee","Talayeh Riahi","Asahi Ushio","Daniel Loureiro","Dimosthenis Antypas","Joanne Boisson","Luis Espinosa-Anke","Fangyu Liu","Eugenio Martı́nez Cámara"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1669852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676388905,"objectID":"797fb0fe2f8af86df4ba8a216fcdabfc","permalink":"https://cardiffnlp.github.io/publication/camacho-collados-etal-2022-tweetnlp/","publishdate":"2023-02-14T15:35:05.213302Z","relpermalink":"/publication/camacho-collados-etal-2022-tweetnlp/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper we present TweetNLP, an integrated platform for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in social media.

In this paper, we focus on NER in Twitter, one of the largest social media platforms, and construct a new NER dataset, TweetNER7, which contains seven entity types annotated over 11,382 tweets from September 2019 to August 2021. The dataset was constructed by carefully distributing the tweets over time and taking representative trends as a basis. Along with the dataset, we provide a set of language model baselines and perform an analysis on the language model performance on the task, especially analyzing the impact of different time periods. In particular, we focus on three important temporal aspects in our analysis: short-term degradation of NER models over time, strategies to fine-tune a language model over different periods, and self-labeling as an alternative to lack of recently-labeled data. TweetNER7 is released publicly (https://huggingface.co/datasets/tner/tweetner7) along with the models fine-tuned on it (NER models have been integrated into TweetNLP and can be found at https://github.com/asahi417/tner/tree/master/examples/tweetner7_paper).","tags":[],"title":"Named Entity Recognition in Twitter: A Dataset and Analysis on Short-Term Temporal Shifts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martina Miliani","Serena Auriemma","Fernando Alva-Manchego","Alessandro Lenci"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1667260800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676384573,"objectID":"4c5a569046dcd8de27af62ea996a49df","permalink":"https://cardiffnlp.github.io/publication/miliani-etal-2022-neural/","publishdate":"2023-02-14T14:22:52.773322Z","relpermalink":"/publication/miliani-etal-2022-neural/","section":"publication","summary":"Automatic Readability Assessment aims at assigning a complexity level to a given text, which could help improve the accessibility to information in specific domains, such as the administrative one.

To deal with data scarcity, we experiment with cross-lingual, cross- and in-domain approaches, and test our models on Admin-It, a new parallel corpus in the Italian administrative language, containing sentences simplified using three different rewriting strategies. We show that NPRMs are effective in zero-shot scenarios (~0.78 ranking accuracy), especially with ranking pairs containing simplifications produced by overall rewriting at the sentence-level, and that the best results are obtained by adding in-domain data (achieving perfect performance for such sentence pairs).

COVID-19 has evidenced the key role of sign language interpreters in delivering nationwide health messages to deaf communities. In this paper, we present a framework for creating a multi-modal sign language interpretation dataset based on videos and we use it to create the first dataset for Peruvian Sign Language (LSP) interpretation annotated by hearing volunteers who have intermediate knowledge of PSL guided by the video audio. We rely on hearing people to produce a first version of the annotations, which should be reviewed by native signers in the future. Our contributions: i) we design a framework to annotate a sign Language dataset; ii) we release the first annotated LSP multi-modal interpretation dataset (AEC); iii) we evaluate the annotation done by hearing people by training a sign language recognition model. Our model reaches up to 80.3% of accuracy among a minimum of five classes (signs) AEC dataset, and 52.4% in a second dataset. Nevertheless, analysis by subject in the second dataset show variations worth to discuss.","tags":[],"title":"PeruSIL: A Framework to Build a Continuous Peruvian Sign Language Interpretation Dataset","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew Shardlow","Fernando Alva-Manchego"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1654041600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676384573,"objectID":"1c32cc95a7f8cb38b522f99e307a89b5","permalink":"https://cardiffnlp.github.io/publication/shardlow-alva-manchego-2022-simple/","publishdate":"2023-02-14T14:22:53.313219Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shardlow-alva-manchego-2022-simple/","section":"publication","summary":"Specialist high-quality information is typically first available in English, and it is written in a language that may be difficult to understand by most readers.

We provide an in-depth description of the annotation process, which entailed designing an annotation manual and employing four annotators (two native English speakers and two native Spanish speakers) who simplified over 6,000 sentences from the English and Spanish portions of the TICO-19 corpus. We report several statistics on the new dataset, focusing on analysing the improvements in readability from the original texts to their simplified versions.

Such relation embeddings are appealing because they can, in principle, encode relational knowledge in a more fine-grained way than is possible with knowledge graphs. To obtain relation embeddings from a pre-trained language model, we encode word pairs using a (manually or automatically generated) prompt, and we fine-tune the language model such that relationally similar word pairs yield similar output vectors.

In this paper, we analyze the capabilities of transformer-based language models on this unsupervised task, using benchmarks obtained from educational settings, as well as more commonly used datasets. We find that off-the-shelf language models can identify analogies to a certain extent, but struggle with abstract and complex relations, and results are highly sensitive to model architecture and hyperparameters.

The remarkable success of word embeddings for this purpose suggests that high-quality representations can be obtained by summarizing the sentence contexts of word mentions. In this paper, we propose a method for learning word representations that follows this basic strategy, but differs from standard word embeddings in two important ways. First, we take advantage of contextualized language models (CLMs) rather than bags of word vectors to encode contexts. Second, rather than learning a word vector directly, we use a topic model to partition the contexts in which words appear, and then learn different topic-specific vectors for each word. Finally, we use a task-specific supervision signal to make a soft selection of the resulting vectors.

At first glance, this may suggest that these models are able to perform medical reasoning tasks, such as mapping symptoms to diseases. However, we find that standard benchmarks such as MedNLI contain relatively few examples that require such forms of reasoning. To better understand the medical reasoning capabilities of existing language models, in this paper we introduce DisKnE, a new benchmark for Disease Knowledge Evaluation. To construct this benchmark, we annotated each positive MedNLI example with the types of medical reasoning that are needed. We then created negative examples by corrupting these positive examples in an adversarial way. Furthermore, we define training-test splits per disease, ensuring that no knowledge about test diseases can be learned from the training data, and we canonicalize the formulation of the hypotheses to avoid the presence of artefacts. This leads to a number of binary classification problems, one for each type of reasoning and each disease.

BERT and its derivatives dominate most of the existing evaluation benchmarks, including those for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), thanks to their ability in capturing context-sensitive semantic nuances. However, there is still little knowledge about their capabilities and potential limitations in encoding and recovering word senses. In this article, we provide an in-depth quantitative and qualitative analysis of the celebrated BERT model with respect to lexical ambiguity. One of the main conclusions of our analysis is that BERT can accurately capture high-level sense distinctions, even when a limited number of examples is available for each word sense. Our analysis also reveals that in some cases language models come close to solving coarse-grained noun disambiguation under ideal conditions in terms of availability of training data and computing resources. However, this scenario rarely occurs in real-world settings and, hence, many practical challenges remain even in the coarse-grained setting. We also perform an in-depth comparison of the two main language model-based WSD strategies, namely, fine-tuning and feature extraction, finding that the latter approach is more robust with respect to sense bias and it can better exploit limited available training data. In fact, the simple feature extraction strategy of averaging contextualized embeddings proves robust even using only three training sentences per word sense, with minimal improvements obtained by increasing the size of this training data.","tags":[],"title":"Analysis and Evaluation of Language Models for Word Sense Disambiguation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luis Espinosa-Anke","Joan Codina-Filba","Leo Wanner"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1617235200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617235200,"objectID":"369a27b2f716bc1495d1a073060a2504","permalink":"https://cardiffnlp.github.io/publication/espinosa-anke-etal-2021-evaluating/","publishdate":"2022-02-19T23:12:41Z","relpermalink":"/publication/espinosa-anke-etal-2021-evaluating/","section":"publication","summary":"Lexical collocations are idiosyncratic combinations of two syntactically bound lexical items (e.g., ''heavy rain'' or ''take a step'').

In this paper, we perform an exhaustive analysis of current language models for collocation understanding. We first construct a dataset of apparitions of lexical collocations in context, categorized into 17 representative semantic categories. Then, we perform two experiments: (1) unsupervised collocate retrieval using BERT, and (2) supervised collocation classification in context. We find that most models perform well in distinguishing light verb constructions, especially if the collocation's first argument acts as subject, but often fail to distinguish, first, different syntactic structures within the same semantic category, and second, fine-grained semantic categories which restrict the use of small sets of valid collocates for a given base.","tags":[],"title":"Evaluating Language Models for the Retrieval and Categorization of Lexical Collocations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Asahi Ushio","Jose Camacho-Collados"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1617235200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617235200,"objectID":"d33df3018091d159ce362b0a4acdb8c6","permalink":"https://cardiffnlp.github.io/publication/ushio-camacho-collados-2021-ner/","publishdate":"2022-02-19T12:47:03Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ushio-camacho-collados-2021-ner/","section":"publication","summary":"Language model (LM) pretraining has led to consistent improvements in many NLP downstream tasks, including named entity recognition (NER).

Such embeddings are commonly used for inferring properties of entities, for recommendation and entity-oriented search, and for injecting background knowledge into neural architectures, among others. Entity embeddings essentially serve as a compact encoding of a similarity relation, but similarity is an inherently multi-faceted notion. By representing entities as single vectors, existing methods leave it to downstream applications to identify these different facets, and to select the most relevant ones. In this paper, we propose a model that instead learns several vectors for each entity, each of which intuitively captures a different aspect of the considered domain. We use a mixture-of-experts formulation to jointly learn these facet-specific embeddings. The individual entity embeddings are learned using a variant of the GloVe model, which has the advantage that we can easily identify which properties are modelled well in which of the learned embeddings. This is exploited by an associated gating network, which uses pre-trained word vectors to encourage the properties that are modelled by a given embedding to be semantically coherent, i.e. to encourage each of the individual embeddings to capture a meaningful facet.","tags":[],"title":"A Mixture-of-Experts Model for Learning Multi-Facet Entity Embeddings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shelan Jeawak","Luis Espinosa-Anke","Steven Schockaert"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1606780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606780800,"objectID":"35ff70d35295581262f80b81261f7e0d","permalink":"https://cardiffnlp.github.io/publication/jeawak-etal-2020-cardiff/","publishdate":"2022-02-19T23:38:11Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jeawak-etal-2020-cardiff/","section":"publication","summary":"We describe the system submitted to SemEval-2020 Task 6, Subtask 1.

When available, linguistic flags pointing to probable anxiety or depression could be used by medical experts to write better guidelines and treatments. In this paper, we develop a dataset designed to foster research in depression and anxiety detection in Twitter, framing the detection task as a binary tweet classification problem.

Second, the use of hard label assignments ignores the fact that different companies will be more or less exposed to a particular segment. To address these limitations, we propose to learn vector representations of companies based on their annual reports. The key challenge is to distill the relevant information from these reports for characterizing their industries, since annual reports also contain a lot of information which is not relevant for our purpose.
