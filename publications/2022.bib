   abstract="Background: Major depressive disorder is a common mental disorder affecting 5{\%} of adults worldwide. Early contact with health care services is critical for achieving accurate diagnosis and improving patient outcomes. Key symptoms of major depressive disorder (depression hereafter) such as cognitive distortions are observed in verbal communication, which can also manifest in the structure of written language. Thus, the automatic analysis of text outputs may provide opportunities for early intervention in settings where written communication is rich and regular, such as social media and web-based forums. Objective: The objective of this study was 2-fold. We sought to gauge the effectiveness of different machine learning approaches to identify users of the mass web-based forum Reddit, who eventually disclose a diagnosis of depression. We then aimed to determine whether the time between a forum post and a depression diagnosis date was a relevant factor in performing this detection. Methods: A total of 2 Reddit data sets containing posts belonging to users with and without a history of depression diagnosis were obtained. The intersection of these data sets provided users with an estimated date of depression diagnosis. This derived data set was used as an input for several machine learning classifiers, including transformer-based language models (LMs). Results: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and MentalBERT transformer-based LMs proved the most effective in distinguishing forum users with a known depression diagnosis from those without. They each obtained a mean F1-score of 0.64 across the experimental setups used for binary classification. The results also suggested that the final 12 to 16 weeks (about 3-4 months) of posts before a depressed user's estimated diagnosis date are the most indicative of their illness, with data before that period not helping the models detect more accurately. Furthermore, in the 4- to 8-week period before the user's estimated diagnosis date, their posts exhibited more negative sentiment than any other 4-week period in their post history. Conclusions: Transformer-based LMs may be used on data from web-based social media forums to identify users at risk for psychiatric conditions such as depression. Language features picked up by these classifiers might predate depression onset by weeks to months, enabling proactive mental health care interventions to support those at risk for this condition. ",

State-of-the-art generative language models have been shown to provide significant gains across different NLP tasks. However, their applicability to data augmentation for text classification tasks in few-shot settings have not been fully explored, especially for specialised domains. In this paper, we leverage GPT-2 (Radford et al, 2019) for generating artificial training instances in order to improve classification performance. Our aim is to analyse the impact the selection process of seed training examples has over the quality of GPT-generated samples and consequently the classifier performance. We propose a human-in-the-loop approach for selecting seed samples. Further, we compare the approach to other seed selection strategies that exploit the characteristics of specialised domains such as human-created class hierarchical structure and the presence of noun phrases. Our results show that fine-tuning GPT-2 in a handful of label instances leads to consistent classification improvements and outperform competitive baselines. The seed selection strategies developed in this work lead to significant improvements over random seed selection for specialised domains. We show that guiding text generation through domain expert selection can lead to further improvements, which opens up interesting research avenues for combining generative models and active learning.",

Nonetheless, this progress has been mainly tested in well-formatted documents such as news, Wikipedia, or scientific articles. In social media the landscape is different, in which it adds another layer of complexity due to its noisy and dynamic nature. In this paper, we focus on NER in Twitter, one of the largest social media platforms, and construct a new NER dataset, TweetNER7, which contains seven entity types annotated over 11,382 tweets from September 2019 to August 2021. The dataset was constructed by carefully distributing the tweets over time and taking representative trends as a basis. Along with the dataset, we provide a set of language model baselines and perform an analysis on the language model performance on the task, especially analyzing the impact of different time periods. In particular, we focus on three important temporal aspects in our analysis: short-term degradation of NER models over time, strategies to fine-tune a language model over different periods, and self-labeling as an alternative to lack of recently-labeled data. TweetNER7 is released publicly (https://huggingface.co/datasets/tner/tweetner7) along with the models fine-tuned on it (NER models have been integrated into TweetNLP and can be found at https://github.com/asahi417/tner/tree/master/examples/tweetner7{\_}paper).",

When it comes to pre-trained language models (PLM), prior work has been focusing on probing relational knowledge this by filling the blanks in pre-defined prompts such as {``}The capital of France is {---}''. However, these probes may be affected by the co-occurrence of target relation words and entities (e.g. {``}capital{''}, {``}France{''} and {``}Paris{''}) in the pre-training corpus. In this work, we extend these probing methodologies leveraging analogical proportions as a proxy to probe relational knowledge in transformer-based PLMs without directly presenting the desired relation. In particular, we analysed the ability of PLMs to understand (1) the directionality of a given relation (e.g. Paris-France is not the same as France-Paris); (2) the ability to distinguish types on a given relation (both France and Japan are countries); and (3) the relation itself (Paris is the capital of France, but not Rome). Our results show how PLMs are extremely accurate at (1) and (2), but have clear room for improvement for (3). To better understand the reasons behind this behaviour and mistakes made by PLMs, we provide an extended quantitative analysis based on relevant factors such as frequency.",

We show that NPRMs are effective in zero-shot scenarios ({\textasciitilde}0.78 ranking accuracy), especially with ranking pairs containing simplifications produced by overall rewriting at the sentence-level, and that the best results are obtained by adding in-domain data (achieving perfect performance for such sentence pairs).

    abstract = "Specialist high-quality information is typically first available in English, and it is written in a language that may be difficult to understand by most readers. While Machine Translation technologies contribute to mitigate the first issue, the translated content will most likely still contain complex language. In order to investigate and address both problems simultaneously, we introduce Simple TICO-19, a new language resource containing manual simplifications of the English and Spanish portions of the TICO-19 corpus for Machine Translation of COVID-19 literature. We provide an in-depth description of the annotation process, which entailed designing an annotation manual and employing four annotators (two native English speakers and two native Spanish speakers) who simplified over 6,000 sentences from the English and Spanish portions of the TICO-19 corpus. We report several statistics on the new dataset, focusing on analysing the improvements in readability from the original texts to their simplified versions. In addition, we propose baseline methodologies for automatically generating the simplifications, translations and joint translation and simplifications contained in our dataset.",

    abstract = "This project investigates the capabilities of Machine Translation models for generating translations at varying levels of readability, focusing on texts related to COVID-19. Whilst it is possible to automatically translate this information, the resulting text may contain specialised terminology, or may be written in a style that is difficult for lay readers to understand. So far, we have collected a new dataset with manual simplifications for English and Spanish sentences in the TICO-19 dataset, as well as implemented baseline pipelines combining Machine Translation and Text Simplification models.",
